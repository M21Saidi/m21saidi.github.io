This project was a comprehensive exploration, divided into two interconnected parts, each adding depth and insight to our understanding of heart disease prediction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"part-1\"\u003ePart 1\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the initial phase of our project, we set the stage by delving into the fundamental concepts of machine learning and data mining as applied in healthcare. We conducted a thorough literature review, explored our dataset through data visualization and feature engineering, and built decision tree models using R. Our focus was on understanding the core aspects of heart disease prediction. The complete story of this phase can be found in the first article on Medium.

Building upon the foundation laid in the first part, we ventured into trying different classification techniques, including neural networks, support vector machines, and naive Bayes. We conducted rigorous model evaluations and comparisons, all with the aim of gaining critical insights into heart disease and its key predictive factors.

Bike sharing systems have emerged as a pioneering solution to these pressing issues, seamlessly integrating technology to revolutionize traditional bike rentals. With over 500 bike-sharing initiatives globally, urban areas such as Hangzhou, Paris, London, New York City, and Montreal have embraced this innovation. Taking Washington\u0026rsquo;s Capital Bikeshare as a prime example, this study draws from its comprehensive dataset to decode the dynamics of daily bike rentals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur analysis, conducted using SAS, began with data preprocessing and exploration, diving deep into patterns influenced by factors such as weather, seasonality, and time of day. The subsequent stages involved rigorous statistical modeling to predict daily bike rental counts. Through these data-driven predictions, we aim to provide stakeholders with actionable insights for operational enhancements and demand forecasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEager to navigate through our detailed findings and insights?
